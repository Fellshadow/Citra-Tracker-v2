### INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS ###

1. Drop all of these files into the same location as citra.py. This is usually in appdata/local.
2. In that same folder (there should now be both citra.py and citra-updater.py in it), shift-right click and select "Open PowerShell Window here" (or something similar - with older versions of windows it may be slightly different). A command-looking prompt should pop up.
3. In that prompt, type "py --version". If this does not show up as 3.12.x, you may need to update your version of python. The program is untested in 3.11.x, but it may be functional.
4. In that same prompt, type "py -m pip install -r requirements.txt". This should install all of the python packages needed to run the tracker, and may take a minute or two. The installed packages should be "PySimpleGUI", "Pillow", and "tk", along with any dependencies therein.
5. After this, you should be good to go! Close out of the command prompt, get your first mon, load up the tracker, and good luck on your journey!
